# AI Basics & History

## AI History
Artificial Intelligence began with the goal of creating machines
that can mimic human intelligence. Early research focused on
rule-based systems and symbolic reasoning.

## Narrow AI
Narrow AI refers to AI systems designed for specific tasks such as
image recognition, language translation, or recommendation systems.
Most AI systems today are Narrow AI.

## Introduction to AI Modules
AI is a broad field consisting of multiple subdomains such as
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics.

## My Understanding
AI has evolved from simple rule-based systems to data-driven
and model-based approaches used in modern applications.
