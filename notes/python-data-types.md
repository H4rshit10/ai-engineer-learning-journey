# Python Data Types

## What are Data Types?
Data types define the type of data a variable can store.
Python automatically assigns a data type when a value is assigned.

## Common Built-in Data Types
- Integer (int)
- Floating point (float)
- String (str)
- Boolean (bool)
- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

---

## Why Data Types are Important
- Help Python understand how to store data
- Determine what operations can be performed
- Improve code readability and correctness

---

## Dynamic Typing
Python is dynamically typed, meaning a variable’s data type
can change during runtime.

## Notes
This document covers the theoretical understanding
of Python data types.
