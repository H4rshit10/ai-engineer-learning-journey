# Generative AI & Large Language Systems

## Generative AI
Generative AI focuses on creating new content such as text,
images, audio, and video.

## Techniques to Achieve Generative AI
- Neural Networks
- Transformers
- Large-scale training data

## Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings represent data in numerical form to capture
semantic meaning.

## Phases in Building Large Language Systems (LLS)
1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training
4. Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and improvement

## My Understanding
Generative AI systems rely heavily on embeddings and
large-scale data to generate meaningful outputs.
