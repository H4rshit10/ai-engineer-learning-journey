# Latency in AI Systems

## What is Latency?
Latency is the time taken by an AI system to respond
after receiving a request.

## Why Latency Matters
- Impacts user experience
- Critical for real-time applications
- Affects system scalability

## Common Causes
- Large model size
- Network delays
- Slow data processing
- Inefficient inference pipelines

## My Understanding
Reducing latency is important for deploying AI models
in real-world applications such as chatbots and
real-time recommendation systems.

## Note
Latency optimization techniques will be explored later.
