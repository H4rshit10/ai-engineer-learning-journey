# AI Evaluation Tools

## What are AI Evaluation Tools?
AI evaluation tools are used to measure the performance,
quality, and reliability of AI and LLM-based systems.

They help assess how well a model performs on specific tasks
and whether it meets expected standards.

## Why Evaluation is Important
- Ensures accuracy and reliability
- Reduces hallucinations
- Helps compare different models
- Improves user trust
- Identifies weaknesses in AI systems

---

## Common Evaluation Areas
- Accuracy and relevance
- Response quality
- Consistency
- Bias and fairness
- Latency and cost
- Robustness

---

## Evaluation in LLM-Based Systems
- Prompt evaluation
- Response comparison
- RAG output validation
- Fine-tuned model assessment

---

## Popular AI Evaluation Tools and Methods
- Human evaluation
- Automated metrics
- Benchmark datasets
- LLM-based evaluators
- Logging and monitoring tools

---

## Use Cases
- Chatbot evaluation
- Search and RAG systems
- Model comparison
- Production AI monitoring
