# Vector Databases

## What is a Vector Database?
A vector database is a specialized database designed
to store, manage, and search vector embeddings efficiently.

It is commonly used in AI applications such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and RAG pipelines.

---

## Why Vector Databases are Needed
- Traditional databases are not optimized for similarity search
- AI models work with embeddings (vectors)
- Enables fast and accurate semantic search

---

## How Vector Databases Work
1. Text or data is converted into vector embeddings
2. Embeddings are stored in the database
3. Similarity search is performed using distance metrics
4. Most relevant vectors are retrieved

---

## Common Distance Metrics
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product

---

## Popular Vector Databases
- FAISS
- Pinecone
- Chroma
- Weaviate
- Milvus

---

## Use Cases
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document search
- Chatbots with memory
- Recommendation systems

## Notes
This document contains conceptual understanding
of vector databases. Practical implementation
will be added later.
