# LangChain

## What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to help
developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It provides tools to connect LLMs with external data,
APIs, memory, and workflows.

---

## Why LangChain is Used
- Simplifies LLM application development
- Helps build RAG-based systems
- Supports chaining multiple components
- Enables integration with tools and databases

---

## Core Concepts of LangChain
- Chains: Sequence of operations involving LLMs
- Prompts: Structured input given to LLMs
- Memory: Maintains context across interactions
- Tools: External functions or APIs used by LLMs
- Agents: LLMs that decide which tools to use

---

## LangChain in AI Applications
- Chatbots
- Question-answering systems
- Document-based assistants
- AI agents and workflows

---

## Relationship with RAG
LangChain is commonly used to implement
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
by connecting vector databases with LLMs.

## Notes
This document contains conceptual understanding
of LangChain. Practical implementation
will be added in future commits.
