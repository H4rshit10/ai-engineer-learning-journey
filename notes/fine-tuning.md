# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models

## What is Fine-Tuning?
Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model
to perform better on a specific task by training it on a custom dataset.

Unlike RAG, fine-tuning updates the model’s internal weights.

---

## Why Fine-Tuning is used
- Improves task-specific performance
- Controls model behavior and tone
- Useful for repetitive or structured tasks
- Reduces prompt engineering complexity

---

## Fine-Tuning Workflow
1. Select a pre-trained base model
2. Prepare and clean the training dataset
3. Format data into input–output pairs
4. Train the model on custom data
5. Evaluate performance
6. Deploy the fine-tuned model

## Notes
This document contains conceptual understanding of fine-tuning.
Practical implementation will be added in future modules.
