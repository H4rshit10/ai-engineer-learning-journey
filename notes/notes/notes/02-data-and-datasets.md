# Data & Datasets

## MNIST Dataset
MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits commonly used
for training and testing machine learning models.

## Labeled vs Unlabeled Data
- Labeled data includes input data with correct output labels
- Unlabeled data contains only input data without labels

## Metadata
Metadata is data that provides information about other data,
such as source, format, and structure.
