# Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning enables systems to learn patterns from data
without being explicitly programmed.

## Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled data to make predictions.

## Unsupervised Learning
Finding patterns in unlabeled data.

## Reinforcement Learning
Learning through rewards and penalties based on actions.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning uses multi-layer neural networks to model
complex patterns.

## Artificial Neural Networks
ANNs are inspired by the human brain and consist of neurons,
weights, and activation functions.

## My Understanding
Machine Learning is the foundation, while Deep Learning is
used for complex data like images and text.
